The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the detection of lung cancer using histopathological images. The objective is to classify lung tissues into three categories: normal, lung adenocarcinomas, and lung squamous cell carcinomas. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the aim is to automate the process of identifying cancerous cells within lung images, facilitating early detection and diagnosis. 

Modules Used

2.0 Pandas
Purpose: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that facilitates the handling of 
structured data in a 2D array format known as a DataFrame. It provides numerous 
functions to efficiently analyze, clean, and manipulate data. In the context of this project, 
Pandas is used to load the dataset into a DataFrame, making it easier to perform various 
analysis tasks.

2.1 Numpy 
Purpose: Numpy is a fundamental library for numerical operations in Python. It 
introduces a fast and efficient array object, known as the Numpy array, which allows for 
large-scale numerical computations. In this project, Numpy is utilized for its array 
operations, particularly in the conversion of images into arrays and handling large 
computations efficiently. 

2.3 Matplotlib 
Purpose: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that enables the creation of static, 
animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is employed for graphically 
representing data and images in this project. Matplotlib aids in visualizing sample images 
from different classes, providing insights into the characteristics of the dataset. 

2.4 Sklearn (Scikit-learn) 
Purpose: Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library that encompasses 
various tools for data preprocessing, model development, and model evaluation. It offers 
pre-implemented functions for tasks such as data splitting, metrics computation, and 
more. In this project, Sklearn is used for splitting the dataset into training and validation 
sets, as well as for evaluating the model's performance. 

2.5 OpenCV 
Purpose: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a dedicated library for 
image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of functions for 
tasks such as image reading, resizing, and manipulation. In this project, OpenCV is 
employed for reading and resizing images as part of the data preparation process. 

2.6 Tensorflow (Keras) 
Purpose: Tensorflow, with the Keras API, is a prominent open-source library for 
machine learning and deep learning. It offers a comprehensive set of functions to build, 
train, and evaluate neural network models. In this project, Tensorflow (Keras) is the 
primary framework for developing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model used 
for lung cancer detection.
